# URL_Hits

## Install

```console
$ npm install
```

## Run

You should build the mongodb and bind on the PORT 27017 yourself.

We would open `PORT 3001` and connect to your mongodb.

because we should connect to our front-end in another project "URL_Hits_frontend".

```console
$ PORT=3001 node bin/www
```

And then, you will see "mongoose opened!" on the screen.
